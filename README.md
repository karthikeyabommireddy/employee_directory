## 🚀 Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 8+ (for Freemarker processing)
- A web server or Java application server (e.g., Tomcat, Spring Boot)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd employee-directory
   ```

2. **For Java/Spring Boot setup:**
   - Add the project files to your Spring Boot application
   - Ensure Freemarker is configured as the template engine
   - Place the files in the appropriate directories as shown in the project structure

3. **For static testing (development):**
   - Open `src/main/resources/templates/index.ftlh` in a browser
   - Note: Freemarker directives will not be processed without a server-side engine

4. **Access the application:**
   - Navigate to your configured server URL
   - The application will load with pre-populated mock data
